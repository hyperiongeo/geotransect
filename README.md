## Dependencies
Some of these dependencies have dependencies of their own, some of which are substantial and need compiling. If you're on a Mac, I recommend using Homebrew for the tricky things like gdal and PROJ4.

- [pyproj](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyproj)
- [fiona](https://github.com/sgillies/fiona): high-level shapefile read/write, wraps GDAL
- [rasterio](https://github.com/sgillies/rasterio): high-level raster read/write, wraps GDAL
- [shapely](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Shapely) probably
- [pyYAML](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyYAML)
- [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) of course
- [SciPy](http://scipy.org/) for some interpolation functions
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) for plotting
- [matplotlib Basemap](https://github.com/matplotlib/basemap) for maps
- [Pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.org/installation.html)
- [obspy](https://github.com/obspy/obspy)
- [bruges](https://github.com/agile-geoscience/bruges/develop), for depth conversion (need **develop** branch at the moment)
- [striplog](https://github.com/agile-geoscience/striplog)
